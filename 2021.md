### *__Minutes__*
* Gary:
   * opencv.org.cn & opencv.org contract is in progress.
   * GSoC ideas list should be further expanded & more mentors should be added.
* Vadim:
   * Conversion of ficus compiler from ocaml to ficus is still in progress. Ocaml sources have been converted to Ficus.
   * Performance regression testing for OpenCV? Funding from opencv.org?
* Vincent:
   * Migration to OpenCV 4.x is still in progress; less and less problems with compiling OpenCV-based projects.
   * One of critical security issues has been fixed.
* Anna:
   * xperience.ai will concentrate on preparing OpenCV 5.0
   * Andrey: Integrated extended PR testing with OpenCV Contrib and OpenCV Extra into the main pipeline. Reproduced DNN testing locally.
   * Anastasia: finalized #17364 (PR: #849, #19477), completed #19366 analysis.
   * Alexander S: Reviewed Ci failures and test hangs. Tuned suppression lists, fixed yet another non-free handling issue (PR #19488).
   * Alexander S: Reviewed issues filed against OpenCV-Python repository. Tested and closed some bugs. Introduced the same milestones as in core OpenCV. Start looking into current CI setup for the repo and weak points.
